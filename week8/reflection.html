    <p>Servers are important becuase they help you/your business with data storage.They also improve efficiency and productivity.
    In this course we learned about backend and incorporating that with frontend.Something I found difficult was the programming itself. Also it was hard for me to understand the concept behind it and why exactly it was useful in the real world.
    Now that i have experienced both frontend and backend I prefer Frontend over backend. I found it a lot more rewarding and satisfying.
